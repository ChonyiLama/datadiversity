# Welcome to the Data and Diversity Project Course!
# ENE, RES 98 section 005

This student project course aims to use data science to better understand how science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) departments can create more equitable, inclusive, and diverse learning environments. The ultimate goal of the course will be a report - or website, or set of data-visualizations - describing findings and recommendations that students will present to decision-makers at UC Berkeley.
