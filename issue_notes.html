#### Readings marked with ++ in front are required
#### HW = Homework suggestions
#### DQ = Discussion Question for class

## State of affairs at UC Berkeley
- ++ Pauker, Madeleine. July 13, 2015. [UC Berkeley’s persistent lack of faculty diversity prompts efforts to address issue.](http://www.dailycal.org/2015/07/12/uc-berkeleys-persistent-lack-of-faculty-diversity-prompts-efforts-to-address-issue/) The Daily Californian.

	- There are nice charts for underutilization of diverse faculty.  Underutilization means that the ratio is worse than the demographics of the job market.  It might be good to project it or something.
	- DQ: Have you noticed lack of diverse faculty in their departments?
	- DQ: What do you think of the metric of underutilization?  

- Campus Climate Surveys: project by the Division of Equity and Inclusion to assess the student experience

	- ++ [Where do we go from here? Highlights from the Campus Climate Survey at the University of California, Berkeley](http://diversity.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/general/uc_berkeley_campus_climate_report_-_where_do_we_go_from_here.pdf) 2015. UC Berkeley: Division of Equity and Inclusion

		- DQ: What result was the least surprising?  Most surprising?
		- Figure 3 shows that sometimes students of different races have different perceptions of how respected students of other races are.  In particular, a much higher percentage of non-black students think that black students are respected while only 47% of black students feel "respected" or "very respected."  At the same time the order of the groups with most to least respect is the similar for each ethnic group.

	- [The Intersection of Campus Climate and the Student Experience.](http://opa.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/NACADA%202014%20-%20Campus%20Climate%20and%20the%20Student%20Experience%20FINAL%20%281%2908_28.pdf) March 26, 2014. UC Berkeley: Division of Equity and Inclusion

	- DQ: What analysis would you be interested in doing on this data (referring to all the data from these surveys)?
	- DQ: What other questions would you be interested in asking?

- ++[The University of California, Statement on Diversity](http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/4400.html)

	- Definition of diversity is "historically excluded populations who are currently underrepresented."

- [Report on the UC Berkeley Faculty Salary Equity Study.](http://vpf.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Equity%20Study%20Report%20final%201-26-15%20--revised.pdf) Jan 2015. UC Berkeley: Office of the Provost

## The Mechanics
####Cognitive Bias

- ++ Project Implicit. Harvard University. https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/
  - HW: Take the Implicit Association Test.   


- ++ Manjoo, Farhad. Sept 24, 2014. [Exposing Hidden Bias at Google.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/technology/exposing-hidden-biases-at-google-to-improve-diversity.html?_r=0) New York Times
  - Some companies such as Google have started requiring this test to make employees (especially managers) aware of their biases.  


- The implicit association test often makes people feel guilty or defensive.  It may be good to ask state off the bat that the vast majority of people are at least slightly biased, and in fact many people are moderately biased.  It is not an indictment of their character.

- Implicit bias is the cumulative effect of learning and absorbing "common sense," "common knowledge", media (a peddler of common knowledge), opinions of those around you, etc.  It is absorbed by everyone, which is why even women or minorities will also score on the association test that they are biased against themselves.  
	- Many decisions are made quickly as the brain is optimized to process things using the least effort.  "Thinking Fast and Slow" by leading researcher Daniel Kahneman describes this in more detail.  He defines System 1 thinking as automatic background processes that are constantly filtering your sensory inputs and pattern-matching.  System 2 processes are slow and deliberate, requiring concentration.  It's what we thinking of as rational thinking.  However, it ultimately is at the mercy of the System 1 information filter.  This is why you often tend to notice events that corroborate what you already believe.

- DQ: What did you think of the bias test?  
- DQ: Should all students, faculty, and staff be required to take it?



####Stereotype Threat

- ++ Steele, Claude M. and Joshua Aronson. 1995. [Stereotype Threat and the Intellectual Test Performance of African Americans.](http://mrnas.pbworks.com/f/claude+steele+stereotype+threat+1995.pdf).  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 
	- HW: Assign to a group to present.
	- This study measured the effects on African Americans.
	- Study 1 uses 114 Stanford undergraduates and describes the test in one of three ways
		- diagnostic of intellectual ability
		- laboratory tool for studying problem-solving 
		- as problem-solving and challenge
	- Study 2 uses 40 students and applied the same methods as Study 1 with the additional step of having students complete the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory afterwards to assess anxiety levels.
	- Study 3 uses about 80 students total with different questions.  Racial references were embedded in the questions.
	- Study 4 uses  about 40 students who answered a questionnaire which 

- Consequences. [Reducing Stereotype Threat](http://reducingstereotypethreat.org/consequences.html).
  - More examples of how stereotype threat can influence the behaviors of a wide range of people.  It does not only affect minority or underprivileged groups.


- Peck, Tabitha, et al. 2013. [“Putting Yourself in the Skin of a Black Avatar Reduces Implicit Racial Bias.”](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810013000597) Consciousness and Cognition
	- HW: assign to group to present

- Many women or minorities are often also one of very few other women and minorities in their class or at their jobs.  The result is that they "represent" their race or gender whether or not they want to (System 1 pattern matching).  Then they have additional pressure not to fulfill their negative stereotypes.

####Imposter Syndrome

- ++ Clance, Pauline Rose., and Suzanne Imes. 1978. [The Imposter Phenomenon in High Achieving Women: Dynamics and Therapeutic Intervention.](http://www.paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf) Psychotherapy Theory, Research and Practice. 
  - This paper coined the term "imposter syndrome," where someone persistently believes that they are phonies in spite of numerous achievements.  Although anyone can experience imposter syndrome, it is more common for women and underrepresented minorities.  While there are many proposed explanations, it isn't really clear why this is.  One reason is that they are more likely to be told at a young age that good scores in school are due to luck while bad scores are due to poor ability while the opposite is true for white boys.  Another reason could simply be that being unusual (different in culture/style/behavior) than their peers is stressful, and the explanation that they are actually just phonies is less confrontational.
  - DQ: Why do you think imposter syndrome is more common and intense among women and underrepresented minorities? 
    
- HW: Find literature or write about your own experiences.
	- After one achieves in the face of stereotype threat, one is often then confronted with imposter syndrome.  
	- How can people overcome stereotype threat AND imposter syndrome?  
	- How can you support others in their endeavors to overcome stereotype threat AND imposter syndrome?  

## Microaggressions and the Language of EID
####Microagressions

- ++ Kingkade, Tyler. July 9, 2015. [Universities are Trying to Teach Faculty How to Spot Microaggressions](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/universities-microaggressions_559ec77be4b096729155bfec). Huffington Post.
  - Microaggressions subtly signal to people when they're perceived as outsiders or expected not to do well or not be interested in something.
  Most statements are not inherently offensive or annoying, but they start to grate on people who get those statements all the time.
  - DQ: Do you experience things that could be considered microaggressions on campus?  If so, has it been helpful to you to describe them as such?

- Sue, Derald Wing and David Rivera. [Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Blog](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/microaggressions-in-everyday-life)
  - Derald Sue is a researcher at Columbia University who played a leading role in developing a list of microaggressions used at many campus diversity trainings.
  - DQ: Are any of these statements confusing about how they could be considered microaggressions?  Let's take a couple and discuss them.
  - DQ: How can we avoid microagressions when we talk to poeple?  To some extent it seems to necessitate being more consciously aware of stereotypes.
  Acknowledging the existence of stereotypes often makes people uncomfortable because it is often conflated with being intentionally prejudiced.
  
####Language of Equity and Inclusion
- ++ [“30 Ways To Be a Better Ally in 2015 — Everyday Feminism.”](http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/01/30-ways-to-be-a-better-ally-in-2014/) 2015. Accessed July 23. 
  - Allies are members in dominant groups and so are often used to privileges of being the dominant group.
  Perhaps the biggest privilege of them all is being listened to rather than dismissed, questioned, or silenced.
  This results in perhaps being overly forthcoming with one's opinions or feelings, drowning out the voices of the people they/we are trying to support.
  Of course, having credibility can be leveraged towards changing the opinions of those people in one's own demographic.
  - On the flip side, many people choose to avoid engaging in these topics for fear of offending people.
  Ultimately, we should all acknowledge that knowing what to say or do to be supportive is challenging.  
  Otherwise these problems would not be as tenacious as they are.
  - DQ: Which suggestion particularly jumps out to you as being particularly important?

- [“Stop Being So Attached!: A Beginner’s Guide on Problematic Language — Everyday Feminism.”](http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/02/guide-on-problematic-language/) 2015. Accessed July 23.
